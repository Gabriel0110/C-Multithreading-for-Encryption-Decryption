# C-Plus-Plus-Multithreading-for-Encryption-Decryption
This was a project in my undergraduate Operating Systems course.  It uses multithreading with p-threads to perform encryption and decryption using fence, hill, and valley threads.


GOAL:
- Encrypt plaintext parts and decipher encrypted parts of a message separately, using p-threads.

To meet goal:
- Write a program that creates a thread named "sifter". Sifter asks user to enter a message (a character string made
up of three parts) as input. If the message is invalid, then the program gives the user only three chances to enter a
valid message. From sifter's point of view, a VALID message is one with three NO-NULL parts. The thread sifter then
creates another thread called "decoder" that takes the message and divides it into its three parts. Part1, Part2, Part3
(WITHOUT THEIR PRECEDING ASTERISKS) are fed to three new threads of "fence", "hill", and "valley", respectively. The
new threads are generated by "decoder".

FENCE THREAD:
- Uses "rail fence decryption" algorithm to DECRYPT a given ciphertext.

HILL THREAD:
- Uses the "hill encryption" algorithm to ENCRYPT a given plaintext.

VALLEY THREAD:
- Uses the REVERSE process of what took place in HILL THREAD to DECRYPT a ciphered text.
